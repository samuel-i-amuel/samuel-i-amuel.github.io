            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hi! My name is Sam Stockbridge. I'm an award-winning 
                data journalist, investigative reporter, graphics developer and
                occasional photojournalist. Welcome to my website!
            </p>
            <p>
                I built this website from scratch with HTML and CSS a few weeks
                ago, so please excuse the rough edges. I'm working on expanding
                it to showcase some of my photography and host interactive graphics
                once I develop some.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For the past six months I’ve been covering the Texas Legislature 
                for Reform Austin, with a focus on public schools and gun violence.
                I followed the arc of Texas private school subsidies from bill to law,
                and the fight for additional public school funding. I also tracked the 
                election of the Texas Democratic Party chair, reporting on the details 
                of a legal challenge to the top candidate’s eligibility.
            </p>
            <p>
                Before I moved to Texas, I lived in Ketchikan, Alaska, for four-and-a-half 
                years, reporting on local government for the Ketchikan Daily News. I covered 
                about 200 meetings of the Ketchikan Gateway Borough Assembly and the Ketchikan 
                School Board, writing them up on a tight deadline to be the community’s definitive 
                account of what happened. I also followed municipal and state elections and 
                the Alaska Marine Highway System.
            </p>
            <p>
                I got my real start in computer-assisted reporting to investigate 
                campaign finance discrepancies in the race for the state House District 
                36 race in Alaska, reporting that earned me an Alaska Press Club award 
                for political coverage. In two weeks, I wrote a Python script to 
                scrape the Alaska Political Offices Commission website for finance 
                data, then clean it and generate summaries of the contributions before 
                rendering graphics of the result. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I used that same script as a framework to illuminate the nuances of
                the 2022 midterm elections in Alaska, work that earned me another 
                award, this time for multimedia presentation.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2024, I switched to a different methodology to produce those 
                graphics directly from the state’s csv files, and used that to 
                deepen my understanding of the state finance to produce summaries 
                of every candidate in the election and generate spreadsheets containing 
                particularly high-value targets.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I’m not writing stories, you might find me at local art galleries, 
                birding on a nature trail, riding my favorite bike, volunteering 
                with my local Rotary club or playing my flute in the park.
            </p>
